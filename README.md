# PyTTF
A script that uses a python script to add new words to a ttf font file.

You can read details from CSDN Blog: https://blog.csdn.net/qq_36618444/article/details/143692646

Because the font files and some xml files are too large to upload, readers can download ttf from the free font library website (https://www.mianfeiziti.com/font_glyph-93305.htm), and use the ttf conversion xml script to convert it.
